# hello-world
I just want to get started. Don't know anything about programming and not even quite sure what GitHub is all about.

I can't really write anything yet for you guys, just bcause I don't even know what my project is yet. I just wanted to try out what
GitHUb is all about and see in how far I can learn from it. And I already noticed that I have to learn a lot.
Once I have an idea for my project, you guys will know first.

Happy to contribute soon! 

This is my edit. Bonsoir
